                        I became a nursing student in July of 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic was still at its height. The
                        decision to become a nursing student came from a love to help people in any way that I could. The
                        Baylor University Nursing program has prepared me thus far to handle the trials of a nursing and
                        eventually become a registered nurse in 2024. Courses in anatomy, microbiology, psychology, and
                        chemistry have inspired and educated me on the workings of the body and the mind. Taking such
                        courses have enlightened me to how complex we all are and I am have excited to learn more and
                        further my career.

                        I joined the Future Nurses Association and the American Medical Womens Association at Baylor
                        University my freshman year and have remained an active member until the end of my sophomore year.
                        Both of these organizations exposed me to individuals going through similar experiences I have,
                        inspiring me ahead. Speakers in the medical field have spoken of their experiences in the medical
                        world, better informing me of my future work. I have also had several opportunities to give back to
                        the community through the Salvation Army and Pack of Hope, broadening my world view.

                        I have been an equestrian hunter/jumper for 15 years. I have a deep respect for the horses that I
                        competed with. I am thankful for my coaches and those in the community that have taught me patience
                        and perseverance in the sport I love.

                    I believe knowing the world and other cultures is a vital aspect to being a well rounded individual.
                    As I am furthering my nursing career, I feel fortunate in the fact that I have been to every state
                    in the U.S. and have traveled to Mexico, England, Scotland, Ireland, and Germany. I have been
                    enlightened to many different cultures on these travels, but recognize I have seen only a small
                    portion of the world and I hope to explore more.
