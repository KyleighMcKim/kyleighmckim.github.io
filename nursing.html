                <p>
                    I became a nursing student in July of 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic was still at its height. The decision to become a nursing student came from a life time with a drive and love to help people in any way that I could. The Baylor University Nursing program as prepared me thus far to handle the trials of a nursing student and eventually a registered nurse in 2024. I have taken anatomy, microbiology, psychology, chemistry, pathophysiology/pharmacology, mental health, pediatrics, obstetricis, leadership, research, and human needs courses that have inspired and educated me on the workings of the body and the mind. Taking such courses of enlightened me to how detail based humans are and I have excited to learn more and further my career.

                    As a pre-nursing student, I waned to be involved in organizations that would help me grow. I joined the Future Nurses Association and the American Medical Womens Association at Baylor University my freshman years and continued to be an active member in both until the end of my sophomore year. Both of these organizations allowed me form a community with individuals going through similar experiences as I had been going through and inspired to me strive ahead. The organizations also had speakers that would give there honest experiences of the medical world and inspire and future medical work force.They opened up opportunities to give back to the community through the Salvation Army and Pack of Hope and allowed me to do something that broadened my view of the world. Currently I am a part of the Baylor Student Nurses Association, Bears with helping hearts, and newly Bears for the Cure.
