                <p>
                    I have had a love and eye of photography for as long as I could remember. I would describe myself as an artistic person, which I believe has helped me achieve the grades I needed in my STEM classes. Through out my highschool career I was in audio/video, photography, and animation courses that thoroughly engaged me. So, when the opportunity arrose in my academic schedule I took that chance to earn a Film and Digital Media minor. As a FDM minor I went through courses that taught me the ins and outs of the film industry, the history of the subject, the art of film making, and the causes and effects the society has on film and how film effects society. https://filmfreeway.com/KyleighMcKim
