                <p>
                    I have had a love and eye of photography and film for as long as I could remember. I would describe
                    myself as an artistic person, something I believe has helped me achieve success in STEM. During my
                    highschool career I took classes in audio/video, photography, and animation. So, when the
                    opportunity arrose in my academic schedule, I earned a minor in Film and Digital Media. As an FDM
                    minor I went through courses that taught me the ins and outs of the film industry, the history of
                    the subject, the art of film making, and the causes and effects society has on film (and how film
                    effects society).
