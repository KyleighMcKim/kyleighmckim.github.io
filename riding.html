                <p>
                    I have been an equestrian hunter/jumper for over 15 years. I started at the age of 6 after being a ballerina and figure skater for the first few years of my life. Finding my love for this sport was where I felt the most confident and inspired the most. I have a deep respect for the horses, and they, my coaches, and those in the community have taught me patience and perseverance. Furthermore, some other activities I enjoy are painting, drawing, scrapbooking, cooking, baking, singing with 6 years in competitive UIL choir, music, and reading.
