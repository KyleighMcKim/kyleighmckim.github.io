                <p>
                    I believe knowing the world and her cultures are one of the vital aspects to being a well rounded individual. As I am furthering my nursing career I feel fortunate in the fact that I have been to every state in the U.S. including Alaska and Hawaii. I have also traveled to Mexico, England, Scotland, Ireland, and Germnay.  I have been enlightened to the rich history and the society of different cultures. I have seen only a small portion of the world and I hope to explore more.                </p>
